## 📝 Notes

- All images are running via Docker's Rosetta 2 translation (ARM64 Mac)
- This is expected and normal - the warning about platform mismatch is informational only
- Performance is excellent even with architecture translation

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Docker Desktop is running**
2. **Verify services are up**: `docker-compose ps`
3. **Check logs**: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
4. **Restart specific service**: `docker-compose restart [service-name]`
5. **Full reset**: `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d`
